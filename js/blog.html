        <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can
            connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of
            the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes
            referred to RESTful APIs.

            First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a
            relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why
            REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices
            architecture.
            REST design principles
            At the most basic level, an API is a mechanism that enables an application or service to access a resource
            within another application or service. The application or service doing the accessing is called the client,
            and the application or service containing the resource is called the server.

            Some APIs, such as SOAP or XML-RPC, impose a strict framework on developers. But REST APIs can be developed
            using virtually any programming language and support a variety of data formats. The only requirement is that
            they align to the following six REST design principles - also known as architectural constraints:

            Uniform interface. All API requests for the same resource should look the same, no matter where the request
            comes from. The REST API should ensure that the same piece of data, such as the name or email address of a
            user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier (URI). Resources shouldn’t be too large but should
            contain every piece of information that the client might need.
            Client-server decoupling. In REST API design, client and server applications must be completely independent
            of each other. The only information the client application should know is the URI of the requested resource;
            it can't interact with the server application in any other ways. Similarly, a server application shouldn't
            modify the client application other than passing it to the requested data via HTTP.
            Statelessness. REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request needs to include all the information
            necessary for processing it. In other words, REST APIs do not require any server-side sessions. Server
            applications aren’t allowed to store any data related to a client request.
            Cacheability. When possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side. Server responses
            also need to contain information about whether caching is allowed for the delivered resource. The goal is to
            improve performance on the client side, while increasing scalability on the server side.
            Layered system architecture. In REST APIs, the calls and responses go through different layers. As a rule of
            thumb, don’t assume that the client and server applications connect directly to each other. There may be a
            number of different intermediaries in the communication loop. REST APIs need to be designed so that neither
            the client nor the server can tell whether it communicates with the end application or an intermediary.
            Code on demand (optional). REST APIs usually send static resources, but in certain cases, responses can also
            contain executable code (such as Java applets). In these cases, the code should only run on-demand.</p>
